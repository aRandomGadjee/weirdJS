# weirdJS
A small collection of JS Weirdness, structured in (hopefully) an easy-to-understand format, so you too can see how bat~~shit~~ crazy JS can be (and maybe prevent some obscure issues in your own code).


### Info:
All the files in this repro have been designed to run in vs code via NodeJS but, as they're all just pure JS, these can be used by any JS compiler 

### Disclaimer
I **DO NOT** recommend that any of these *snippets* are used in any production code; these are purely here for my enjoyment.

Especially the use of the JS function 'eval'! Eval ***is*** **EVIL** and one of the most dangerous things in JS...
